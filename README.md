# dog-or-cat-image-classifier-
image classifier that detects whether the image has a cat or dog.using matplotlib,tensorflow,cv2 .dataset is from kaggle

This my first project in the field so it has some jank due to using stuff that i dont understand too much.
training accuracy:0.9426, 94.26%,
Training loss: 0.1241,
Validation accuracy: 0.7686 (76.86%) 
Validation loss: 0.9403

tried to remove overfitting by batchNormalization and dropout,it still classifies dog as cat or vis-versa sometimes
